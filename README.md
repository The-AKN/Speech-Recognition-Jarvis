# Speech-Recognition-Jarvis
I made Speech Recognition using Python libraries 
Which perform tasks on voice commands like open Google Search, Youtube, Powerpoint, Word, Current Date and Time, Temperature , Sending whatsapp messagesetc.
If you want to run the project then firstly make a new folder and copy all these files to tha folder, after that run jarvis_main.py. it will ask for password 
so use AKN as a password, you can also change the password.
